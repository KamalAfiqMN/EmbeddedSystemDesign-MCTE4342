# Embedded System Design Exercise 7

**Blinking LEDs by using delay and millis**

There are two LEDs whose anodes are connected to PB0 and PB1 respectively. The LED 1
needs to be flashing with ON time 750 ms and OFF time 350 ms. The LED 2 needs to be
flashing with ON time 400 and OFF time 600 ms.

Equipments:

1. UNO board
2. Breadboard
3. LED x2
4. Jumper Wires x3
5. 220-ohm resistor x2

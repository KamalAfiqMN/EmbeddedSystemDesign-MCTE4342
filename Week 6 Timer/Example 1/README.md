**Internal Timers of Arduino**

We want to count accurate time without the use of delay() function because during the delay 
we simply cannot do anything. However, by using the internal timers of Arduino, we can do 
anything we want in the mean time because it will simply interrupt when the moment comes. 
We will use the TIMER0 since it is the easiest timer.

Components:

1. Arduino UNO
2. Breadboard
3. Jumper Wires
4. 220-ohm resistor
5. LED

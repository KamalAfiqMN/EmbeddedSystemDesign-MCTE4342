# Timer example 3
**Theoretical frequency of the generated PWM signal**

Write a program to produce a PWM signal with 50% duty cycle on Channel B
of timer0. Use Fast PWM mode, pre-scaler value of 1, top value of 5.
Determine the theoretical frequency of the generated PWM signal.
List all the PWM duty cycles that can be generated using the above settings.
            
            
                        0% 25% 50% 75% 100%

# Write Example
**EEPROM Write**

The microcontroller on the Arduino boards have 512 bytes of EEPROM: memory whose values are kept when the board is turned off (like a tiny hard drive).

This example illustrates how to store values read from analog input 0 into the EEPROM using the EEPROM.write() function. These values will stay in the EEPROM when the board is turned off and may be retrieved later by another sketch.

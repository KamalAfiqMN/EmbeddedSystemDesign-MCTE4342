# Read Example
**EEPROM Read**

The microcontroller on the Arduino boards have 512 bytes of EEPROM: memory whose values are kept when the board is turned off (like a tiny hard drive).

This example illustrates how to read the value of each byte EEPROM using the EEPROM.read() function, and how to print those values to the serial window of the Arduino Software (IDE).
